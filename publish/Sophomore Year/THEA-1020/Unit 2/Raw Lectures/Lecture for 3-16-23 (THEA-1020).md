- Remember that after the English Civil War, the Puritans took over and executed Charles I in 1649
	- **Oliver Cromwell** ruled England afterwards
	- Charles II ran off in exile to avoid death
- **The Commonwealth**
	- The time after the execution of Charles I and the reinstatement of his son Charles II is called the Commonwealth

- Most fun things were <u>banned</u> during the Commonwealth
	- Puritans believed in an austere lifestyle
	- Celebration of traditional holidays suppressed
	- Music, dancing, and singing were limited
	- No gambling
	- Books that did not adhere to Puritan philosophy were banned
	- Theatre was completely banned in 1642, with the playhouses being fully dismantled
		‣ However, some entertainments were secretly organized in private homes
- **William Davenant**
