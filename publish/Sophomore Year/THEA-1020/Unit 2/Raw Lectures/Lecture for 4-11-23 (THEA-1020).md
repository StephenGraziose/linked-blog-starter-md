### Theatres from 1915 to 1950 (Part II)

- Theatres under Totalitarianism
	- Some forms of theatre were completely suppressed by the government in some totalitarian regimes
	- However, some other forms of theatre were encouraged
		‣ Particularly in the Soviet Union under Stalin, and Germany under Hitler, government-supported theatre served as instruments of propaganda
- **Propaganda**
	- Information, especially of a biased or misleading nature, used to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view
- Theatres under Totalitarianism: The Soviet Union
	- 1930s, Socialist Realism was the only acceptable form of theatre back in the day
	- Plays to be written in a realistic style, and convey a pure socialist message (propaganda)
- Theatres under Totalitarianism: The Third Reich
	- Melodramas exalting Nazism were produced, as well as mass spectacles that supported the Third Reich
		‣ One of these is "Deutsche Passion"
			- Hitler is literally a Christ figure
			- The Passion of Christ but with Hitler  
- Suppression of Anti-Totalitarian Artists
	- Artists who opposed totalitarian regimes often suppressed
	- Soviet Union:
		‣ Meyerhold was put in a labor camp and killed

	- Germany:
		‣ Many artists who opposed the Third Reich either fled (Brecht) or were sent to concentration camps
- Theatre as a form of Resistance
	- Nazi guards at Dachau forced internees to stage productions for them as a form of entertainment

- American Theatre
	- During the war years, some experiments in non-realism occurred during this time period

- **The Shubert Organization**
	- The Theatrical Syndicate monopoly was toppled in 1915 by the Shubert family

- The Rise of the Musical
	- The most commercially successful form of American theatre was (and is) the musical
	- Genre began in the 1920s with popular music reviews
	- **The Ziegfield Follies**
		‣ Annual Broadway music review
		‣ Lasted for decades and decades
	- Out of these music reviews was born the musical comedy, which blossomed in the 1920s and the 1930s
	- These are being called "reviews" because they're not fully-fledged musicals yet
- Musicals
	- Musicals then, and now, ruled Broadway
	- Ticket prices are still higher for musicals, they usually have far longer runs than "straight plays"
	- At first, most musicals had very silly, inconsequential stories
		‣ There became two notable exceptions to this, however 
- ***Show Boat* (1927)**
	- A landmark production
	- Songs and dance move plot and character development forwards
	- Featured an interracial cast, and themes that were progressive for their time

- ***Oklahoma!** (1943)*
	- A breakthrough musical as well
	- Songs are an extension of the spoken text
	- The "dream ballet" integrated dance into the plot
	- Instead of functioning as an interlude or diversion, the ballet provided insight into the heroine's emotional turmoil  
- **The Great Depression**
	- American commerical theatre boomed through the 1920s, but then the Great Depression occurred after the Stock Market Crash in 1929
	- Theatre became a luxury many people could not afford
