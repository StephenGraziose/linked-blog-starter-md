**Roleplaying**
		‣ Assuming a specific set of behavior for a role, including social roles, in order to be socially accepted by our peers
			• Being a family member, being in a certain job, being a student, etc.
			• Like how you act different in class vs with friends
			• We play roles to achieve certain goals, be it financial goals, social acceptance, and success
				◦ You roleplay for success
					‣ Fake it 'till you make it
		‣ Not exactly theatre, but it basically is!
