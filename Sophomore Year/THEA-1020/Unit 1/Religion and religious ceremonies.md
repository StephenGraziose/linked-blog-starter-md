**Religion and religious ceremonies**
		‣ Very close cousins to theatre
			• Even have a ton of overlap too
		‣ **Ceremonies** are a formal religious or social occasion
			• Usually led by a designated authority figure
			• Ceremonies often include:
				◦ A script
				◦ Dialogue
				◦ Props
				◦ Music
				◦ Costumes
				◦ People assuming roles
		‣ **Rituals** are the acting out of an established, prescribed procedure
			• Tend to be less formal
			• "Stuff we always do"
				◦ Eating dinner as a cohesive family at 5:30 every night, etc. 
		‣ Both rituals and ceremonies are quite similar though, as they involve performing a specific set of events
		‣ Rituals and ceremonies are quite similar to theater too
			• All have some props, roles, lighting, set, etc.
			• Many anthropologists argue that rituals and ceremonies grew out of theater
		‣ However, rituals and ceremonies are also quite different from theater too:
			• **Group-sharing/Methexis**
				◦ To embody or to be as opposed to act
					‣ The person is overtaken, and for a time, BECOMES someone else
					‣ Audience participation, group creativity, and improvisation
				◦ Done in voodoo, Yoruba ceremonies, etc.
				◦ You don't have an audience, per-se, everyone IS in it
				◦ Everyone becomes a part of it
				◦ Blue Man Group is also an example of this
				◦ Participatory theater is considered theater instead of methexis 
					‣ No, because not everyone in the audience is a part of it
					‣ There is still an audience
					‣ People are aware that it is all a performance
					‣ People incorporated into it are not BECOMING some form of entity, they are just acting 
			• **Efficaciousness**
				◦ The intent to achieve results
				◦ Rituals are done with this in mind
					‣ Rain dance, crop fertility, connecting two people as one, summoning something, etc.
					‣ Theater does NOT have efficaciousness in mind really
						• Well, theater has like some goal, such as making money or conferring an idea or entertaining, but it's not like a metaphysical or physical result
						• "Theater exists for its own sake, and the focus is always on us - human beings." - The textbook
							◦ Theater does not appeal to outside forces, rituals do
